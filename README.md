# SincroDirs
Gnome Shell extension for folders synchronization.

Uses rysnc as a backend.

Thanks to [randwall](https://github.com/rodakorn/randwall) extension, help me a lot to understand how to make an extension.

Features
--------
* Default options for synchronize are: -rlptq.
* Modify rsync options with two options: delete and compress.
* Create a custom rsync options string.
* Create groups of folders with one common destination.
* Enable/disable groups for synchronize.
* Synchronize a group of folders to a common destination.
* Notification support.
* Available in english and spanish.

Settings
--------
The first time the extension is executed needs to be configured. When you click on the folder with arrows icon it displays a message and a '+' button. Click the '+' button to configure the extension and add folders.

Here you can modify the default options for rsync, -rlptq, and add the delete or compress options or set a new ones. Warning! Must be correct rsync options!

Next you can add groups of folders to synchronize, add folders to the groups and add destination folders to the groups. You can can select a folder and remove it, or select a group and remove the group and all it's folders.

If you have configured the extension, now you can click again on the extension icon to view the groups to synchronize and some information of the last synchronization. You can click on the switch button to activate/deactivate that group synchronization.
